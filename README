This is a first shot at some kind of generic "webhook" Notifier for builds.

Currently I'm not quite sure if this makes any sense or if specialized plugins for every
webservice are better, e.g. because having it generic will be too much of a hassle to
configure.

Beware: Currently this is completely non-functional. I am rather happy that I finally got the
configuration persistence right. Writing Hudson plugins is a PITA if you are usually hacking ruby.
